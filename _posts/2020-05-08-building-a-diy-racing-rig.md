I enjoy racing games. I wanted to build the most fun racing rig I could for the least amount of money.

Here's how I did it:

Tools:

- (Impact) Drill
- Staple Gun (opt.)

BOM (~\$300):

- [Logitech G29 Racing Wheel for PS4/PC (~\$220)](https://amzn.to/2WDU7fp)\*
- [USB 3.0 Extension (~\$8)](https://amzn.to/35Hi5dK)
- A Chair
- 2"x12"x8' (1) - base, and seat base
- 2"x4"x8" (~4) - seat angle, pedal angle, wheel mounting board beam
- 1" common board - pedal base, wheel mounting board
- Construction Screws
- [Wood Glue (~\$8)](https://amzn.to/2yxjurj)
- [Cable Management Velcro (~\$16)](https://amzn.to/2SPDOuO)

\* Price fluctuates pretty wildly, I picked mine up for the listed price.

I like to cut some short lengths of cable management velcro and staple it in to the wood to create loops to retain the wires. You could alternatively use screws rather than staples. I'd suggest a couple of loops to make sure the wires are tucked out of the way.

Use the USB extension to give yourself some extra distance between your console / PC and the racing rig.
