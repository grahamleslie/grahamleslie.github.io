I've been providing premier software development and advisory services since I founded [Quill Dynamics](https://quilldynamics.com/) in 2013. I've worked with a wide range of clients, from small startups to large enterprises, and I've helped them solve their problems and build and scale their business with lean, effective software.

Please reach out via LinkedIn if you're interested in my services.
